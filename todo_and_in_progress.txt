- Update the graphics
- Make a logo
- Add .ico
- Update the wiki
- Add BCC option

** IN PROGRESS **

- Add an inbox (Used protocol for this is POP3, since there aren't any good IMAP4 libraries for .NET 4.5, it's added but it doesn't work for some reason...)
- More noob-proofing (exception handling, testing etc)
- Working on the website for the program
  - Going to implement a feedback system on the website instead of this file
